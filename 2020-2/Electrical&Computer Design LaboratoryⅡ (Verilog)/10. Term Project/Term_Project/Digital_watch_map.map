WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator M0/M1/MERIDIEM_not000111 failed to
   merge with F5 multiplexer M0/MERIDIEM_not0001_f5.  There is a conflict for
   the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           531 out of   3,840   13%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,655 out of   3,840   69%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,514 out of   1,920   78%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,514 out of   1,514 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,514   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,875 out of   3,840   74%
    Number used as logic:             2,655
    Number used as a route-thru:        220

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 33 out of     141   23%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of       8   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.11

Peak Memory Usage:  4401 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
